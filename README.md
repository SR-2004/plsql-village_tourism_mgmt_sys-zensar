Project Name : Village Tourism Management System 

Project Description:This project focuses on developing an Oracle-based Village Tourism Management System that manages various tables related to villages and their attractions. The system supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to efficiently insert, retrieve, and manage information about different villages, tourist spots, accommodations, and local events.

Advanced database features like triggers and cursors are utilized to automate data fetching and ensure that tourists receive comprehensive and up-to-date information about popular and recommended destinations. The system performs various operations to provide accurate and desirable results, enhancing both the management process and the overall tourist experience.
